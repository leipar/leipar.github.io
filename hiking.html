            - Mosquito repellent
            - Cellphone
            
            For longer, tougher hikes you may want to also include:
            - Work gloves
            - Sweater
            - First Aid Kit
            - Additional water and food

            For safety reasons, DO NOT hike alone if at all possible, but if you must, make sure to tell someone where you are going.

Stick to the trail and follow trail head markers to avoid getting lost. With a little preparation, your hike on the island of Hawaii will reap unforgettable rewards.

        <h2>MOUNTAIN HIKING</h2>
        <p>The island of Hawaii is heaven for hikers. Whether you’re looking for a challenging trail on fields of lava or short, scenic hikes through historic sites, you’ll find it here.

            Most hiking adventures begin in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which offers more than 150-miles of trails. Stroll through Nahuku (Thurston Lava Tube), take a day hike along Chain of Craters Road or walk over volcanic fields to witness the power of creation as lava flows into the sea in Kalapana. For the well-equipped and experienced backpackers, hike overnight in the park's backcountry. See a ranger at the Kilauea Visitor Center to get trail information, maps and permits.
            
            Other famous hikes can be found on the Kona Coast on the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail, also known as the King’s Trail. This 175-mile trail weaves through hundreds of important cultural sites including sacred heiau (temples), Hawaiian fishponds, petroglyphs and other historic sites. You’ll also find a variety of other amazing hikes including the Pololu Valley Lookout in North Kohala which leads to a black sand beach and guided hikes into lush Waipio Valley, known as the Valley of Kings</p>
