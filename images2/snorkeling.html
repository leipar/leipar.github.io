        <p class="text-left">Hawaii is among one of the best destinations to go snorkeling thanks to the protected marine areas surrounding the islands. From its crystal-clear waters, its teeming sea life and the tropical, vacation-like weather to all the luxuries a Hawaiian vacation has to offer, there's almost no place like it.

            Snorkeling in Maui offers some of the best opportunities for swimming with sea turtles. If you're interested in a deeper understanding of the marine biology of Hawaii, join Ocean Ramsey's research team in Oahu. Anini Beach on the island of Kauai provides snorkelers with access to the Rhe Honoiki reef, the largest coral reef in Hawaii. And if you want to walk away from your trip with a one-of-a-kind experience, swim at night with reef manta rays on Hawaii's Big Island.
            
            It doesn’t matter which island you choose. If you’re snorkeling in Hawaii, you are sure to enjoy your underwater adventure. Here are the best places for snorkeling around the Hawaiian Islands, plus the specific sea life you can expect to see below the surface.</p>

        <h2>Kealakekua Bay State Historical Park – Big Island</h2>
        <p class="text-left">Hawaii's Big Island offers numerous snorkeling spots. Kayak along the calm waters of Kealakekua Bay while keeping your eyes peeled for Hawaiian spinner dolphins; they like to put on a show. Once you reach the protected shoreline of Ka’awaloa, hop out and snorkel alongside turtles, eels, reef sharks and rays. Bring a picnic lunch and sit a spell near the monument of British explorer Captain James Cook. (Note: If you kayak on your own you are not allowed to dock on shore. If you go with an outfitter like Kona Boys, you may.)</p>
